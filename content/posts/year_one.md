## origins of hitorilabs

> \> Yes - it's true. I started this thing after finishing all
12 episodes of [Bocchi the Rock!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocchi_the_Rock!) 
> \- ([my first post](/posts/inspiration))

If you are reading this post, I assume you have seen some of my stuff from
twitter and maybe you even interacted w/ me before (thank you, I appreciate you)

In case you were wondering - **hitorilabs** is the only account I have on
twitter. I didn't really understand it early on, but I must've been super lucky
that the first few people I interacted with were from the cool and funny side
instead of the angry political side.

Nowadays, my twitter experience is pretty cozy. To put things in perspective,
whenever I decide to boot up the app this is what the timeline looks like:
1. 40% tech/animu meme (dingboard probably skewed this)
2. 30% technical discussions/replies + papers
3. 15% literally gm + lifestyle post
4. 15% tech bros posting about building (surely you guys are building right?)

It's truly amazing how you can just post and reply to internet strangers and
you will eventually reach someone who can both give you a good laugh and drop
the realest wisdom + advice at the same time

## what did we do in 2023

1. Completed my first full year of real FT software work (no more analytics bs)
2. Setup homelab. It's in a pretty good spot + I actually got to learn a lot
   from tinkering on my own hardware
3. Uncovered incredible memes + alpha on twitter through this dinky little
   account I started

## how did we feel in 2023

1. I am honestly a bit disappointed by how little I actually accomplished on
   paper, yet I still feel like it was the greatest year I've ever had in terms
   of personal development
2. Layoffs had me feeling kinda nervous, but I somehow survived the whole thing
   and instead we got a generous pay bump + minimized company burn, now we
   basically have infinite runway
3. I am feeling a lot more focused nowadays - offloaded a lot of lingering
   thoughts about random career paths, projects, etc.

At the start of the year, I was still kind of normie-pilled and I considering
going back to finish my degree + progress on the career ladder like a normal
person. 

I was unironically watching advice videos about "career growth" - but
tbh I think it's pretty much fake outside of big co's and licensed jobs.

## what are we doing in 2024

The plan for 2024 is simple:
1. become sand-bending super neet in digital space
2. move heavy thing and become jacked beyond imagination

Mostly larp-maxxing, but I'm actually just super hyped.

Happy New Year!
