## origins

Yes - it's true. I started this thing after finishing all
12 episodes of
[Bocchi the Rock!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocchi_the_Rock!)

I would work on this stuff on main, but it sounds a lot
more fun to do it this way. 

## programming legends
In all my years of living, I've learned that the greatest
programmers have the following archetype:

1. anime pfp 
2. shitpost on twitter
3. active on github

## what are we going to work on?
I've got a laundry list of things that I'm planning for:

1. I'm not an expert with this AI stuff, but this stuff
is fun. I'm working on catching up to start moving the
needle on AI art.
2. I've been running Apple Silicon machines for a while
because they have crazy memory bandwidth - however the
software hasn't caught up yet.
3. VTuber software is ridiculously bloated and complex.
We would get some real innovation if the whole thing was
free, open-source, implemented in Python, and under 1K
lines of code. You should be able to run a full streaming
setup on a decent macbook air.
