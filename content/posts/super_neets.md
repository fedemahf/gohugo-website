# what is a super neet?

![super neet post](/assets/super_neet_post.png)

I don't think it's just anime pfps, autism, nootropics, or any other obscure
traits and behaviors that these people seem to have. 

It's all probably just part of a funny bit.

Look past the fun and eccentric persona and you'll realize these are good
people who are actually cracked all around:

1. strong executive function
2. deep in a skill tree + well-versed across domains
3. highly charismatic

Maybe the white pill is that they probably only had slightly above average IQ
and relatively ordinary circumstances. 

The rest of their success can probably be attributed to the tendency to work
hard + read a lot (internet, blogs, books, etc.)

# the super neet filter

The world we created is hostile towards ordinary neets.

Born to neet, forced to fit the norm.

This is good, actually.

"Doing things that normal people do" keeps you grounded in reality and you'll
be rewarded quite well for being a good participant in this system.

The thing about becoming a neet *later* in life is that the path is not obvious
and things will get much worse before it ever seems to get better.

This is the super neet filter.

# worth an attempt

The super neet is probably an end-game for most people, but many will overstate
the difficulty and underestimate the time it takes to get there.

We can still win the war on neets, there's a way out.

Become the neet in the shadows. Become the **employed neet**.
