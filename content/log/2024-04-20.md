honestly thought it was all doomed, but we managed to find the answer from some legend in the nvidia forums in 2022 (see [forum post](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/nvrm-this-pci-i-o-region-assigned-to-your-nvidia-device-is-invalid/229899))

> Itâ€™s a very common problem with pci resource allocation, i.e. the memory window sizes and regions a pci device wants (BAR). Initially assigned by the bios but sometimes incorrectly/incompatible so pci=realloc enables the kernel to change the regions.

`sudo vim /etc/default/grub`

```
...
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash pci=realloc"
...
```

Then `sudo update-grub`

This should help you recover bar0

then the next issue i was running into is that the mobo would get stuck w/ debug code 29 and only one of the GPUs were detected.

to fix this i saw some suggestions about disabling CSM in BIOS and eventually i got everything to boot properly
