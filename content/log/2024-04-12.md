03:04 no plan yet, because this is still the previous day - just waiting on these big ass models to download atm

when will i actually go to sleep today is the real question, i'll queue up command-r-plus and mixtral-8x22b before i go to bed for sure tho.

01:35 seeing the light of vllm...

interesting, but kind of expected that on 4x3090 i get much lower throughput (1K t/s for generation on 4x3090 vs. 1.7K t/s on 1x4090 running mistral 7b) - not a real benchmark btw.

i'm basically building something like lilac, but fully fledged with a whole training + eval stack

i was always asking myself why people don't post their bespoke training setups, but then i realized nobody is going to actually open source their money printer... i don't really buy the idea that it's just too messy or that it's too risky (which is also understandable)
