saw a tweet about flashcards and finally deciding to try it out

i've avoided this for a long time because i didn't want to go through the process of turning my notes into flashcards.

however, today i just thought... why don't i just treat my notes as flashcards?

basically i just have an interface good enough to cycle through my notes with some kind of control over what i want to see. 

i'm using mochi cards to do this for now and it feels like it makes sense. 

use cases so far:
- spam space over "favourite tweets" deck for motivation (have a separate deck for memes)
- revising/rewriting old notes or just acknowledging things i wrote a long time ago
- making cards for my backlog to keep me accountable
