last week i put a bit too much on my plate at work... 

you should always pace yourself, space out your work, and leave room to reflect - especially in a team setting. 

the last thing you want to do is create an environment where people feel like they're being left in the dust. make sure you have at least a few people along for the ride

## plan for the day
- finish up the last few things on my work project and tomorrow will have to send some emails + documentation
- probably "algorithms for modern hardware" or "linux from scratch"
- plan for new project

20:11 reversing the order of everything... as i end the day i'll do more reflection instead of just writing random stuff

currently working on something like https://github.com/lilacai/lilac but one that i just roll by hand so that i don't have to suffer through refactoring their stuff. 

tbh there aren't too many features in there that are actually useful to me so it can't be that hard... right?

18:42 god i'm such a svelte stan

don't fall for the HTMX meme. gotta get good at throwing UIs together

14:51 some reflections on what i've been thinking about:

pasting a comment i wrote from one of my private repos, not sure if any it is accurate opinions, but this is the vibe i get so maybe someone can correct me

Half-baked opinions about training frameworks:

# out-of-the-box/drop-in/user-friendly
- `axolotl` - authors + contributors implement lots of things to work out of the box, implements lots of bleeding edge stuff like FSDP + QLORA (uses accelerate, training runs are just yaml configs)
- `accelerate` - "drop-in" + easily "wraps" HF transformer models to run distributed which enables various backends like deepspeed, FSDP, etc.  
(i.e. you'll see some examples of drop-in code to make ordinary training loops work in distributed environment)
- `lightning` - opinionated to prioritize ease of use + readability, works on neat things like `litgpt` https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litgpt


## "backends"

- `deepspeed` - bleeding-edge optimizations on top of torch + FSDP (usually a "backend" made available for other frameworks)
- `fsdp` - (and building everything else out yourself on torch and maybe plug in custom triton/cuda kernels) but you basically try to "wrap" your model with a layer to describe your distributed environment.

 14:29 i'm awake again, but i just realized it's the same day... i'll come up with a structure for these logs and probably update this one. also added this shortcut for timestamps

---

04:20 another annoying challenge... 

because of limitations in obsidian, i can't set the attachments directory as a folder outside the vault (i.e. `/static/log_images`) so a decent solution is to make  a symlink inside the vault out to the static directory and then just hide it from github

took way longer than it should've lmao

now you get futaba.png

gn (gm)

03:30 couldn't sleep and it's 3am rn. 

i messed up my sleep schedule a few days ago grinding out some work... never again.

i created a vault for this directory and added the git plugin to obsidian so that it's easier to do frequent commits with little messages. 

i'll still manually push so that I can do fixups and what not before everything gets deployed. ideally i also want to double check the changes and see how everything gets rendered on the site.

as long as this plugin doesn't do something wild and dox tf out of me somehow... we're good.

saw [@lelouchdaily](https://twitter.com/lelouchdaily)'s daily log and felt inspired :)
