couldn't sleep and it's 3am rn. 

i messed up my sleep schedule a few days ago grinding out some work... never again.

i created a vault for this directory and added the git plugin to obsidian so that it's easier to do frequent commits with little messages. 

i'll still manually push so that I can do fixups and what not before everything gets deployed. ideally i also want to double check the changes and see how everything gets rendered on the site.

as long as this plugin doesn't do something wild and dox tf out of me somehow... we're good.

saw [@lelouch](https://twitter.com/lelouchdaily)'s daily log and felt inspired :)

another annoying challenge... 

because of limitations in obsidian, i can't set the attachments directory as a folder outside the vault (i.e. `/static/log_images`) so a decent solution is to make  a symlink inside the vault out to the static directory and then just hide it from github

took way longer than it should've lmao

now you get futaba.png
