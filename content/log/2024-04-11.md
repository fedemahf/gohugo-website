last week i put a bit too much on my plate at work... 

you should always pace yourself and space out your work and leave room to reflect, especially in a team setting. 

the last thing you want to do is create an environment where people feel like they're being left in the dust. make sure you have at least a few people along for the ride

## plan for the day
- finish up the last few things on my work project and tomorrow will have to send some emails + documentation
- probably "algorithms for modern hardware" or "linux from scratch"
- plan for new project

03:30 couldn't sleep and it's 3am rn. 

i messed up my sleep schedule a few days ago grinding out some work... never again.

i created a vault for this directory and added the git plugin to obsidian so that it's easier to do frequent commits with little messages. 

i'll still manually push so that I can do fixups and what not before everything gets deployed. ideally i also want to double check the changes and see how everything gets rendered on the site.

as long as this plugin doesn't do something wild and dox tf out of me somehow... we're good.

saw [@lelouch](https://twitter.com/lelouchdaily)'s daily log and felt inspired :)

another annoying challenge... 

because of limitations in obsidian, i can't set the attachments directory as a folder outside the vault (i.e. `/static/log_images`) so a decent solution is to make  a symlink inside the vault out to the static directory and then just hide it from github

took way longer than it should've lmao

now you get futaba.png

![](/log_images/futaba.png)

 14:29 i'm awake again, but i just realized it's the same day... i'll come up with a structure for these logs and probably update this one. also added this shortcut for timestamps
