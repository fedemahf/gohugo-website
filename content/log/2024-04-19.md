missed a day, but who's keeping count anyways

not gonna lie, i can pretty much confirm that i'm not much of a travel person. i have the most fun when it's not for leisure.

this work trip felt like leisure because there wasn't a super specific thing that we needed to meet together on. nonetheless, west coast is way more vibrant than the canadian suburbs so it was great vibes.

the other thing i noticed is how nerfed i felt during the moments in time when i had no internet...

i felt like a neanderthal digging up man pages and praying that i manage to find useful READMEs. i don't think this is a sign that we need on-device inference, more like i should carry around some offline backups of my own stuff.
