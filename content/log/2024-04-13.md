18:25 it's over... it has literally been over 12 hours of debugging and i still can't quite figure it out. at least i know that i didn't brick all my GPUs

w/o resizeable bar

WHERE IS BAR 0 BRO???? I LITERALLY GOT SO CLOSE

on the desktop mobo, BAR 0 is there as expected... but on my server rig it's gotta be the firmware on the motherboard. if anyone else is doing this with 3090s on a ROMED8-2T board, let me know. 

you have to flash a new vbios onto the GPUs (depends on the OEM) and there's a bios update for the mobo that adds resizeable bar. after all this i get the error above.

at least now i actually know my computer a little better now (cope)

06:20 been up since 1AM trying to see if can get p2p working on my cards... it was trivial to update the motherboard bios to support resizable bar, but ultimately i'm stuck on needing to flash the new vbios... and asus shipped an executable that only runs on windows????
