i'm tired asf, it's over... no it's not over

nothing really to post about... but i'll drop some quick alpha for my writer bros out there

in order to get it to show up at all, you have to fulfill certain meta tag requirements. for me, it was already mostly fulfilled by the hugo opengraph template so that image previews actually show up (see [twitter docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/markup))

however, it was only a small image and it turns out there are a few extra requirements to convince it to show the large image preview (see [twitter docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image))

since i already left a block for extra SEO tags, all I had to do was make a [few line change](https://github.com/hitorilabs/hitorilabs.github.io/commit/ac9e2cddf502b92e457e58f192c849f5e746797d)
# another thing
i just want to take a moment and appreciate that there has consistently been at least a couple people who actually go out of their way to give me some motivate to write despite being terrible at it. 

i don't expect anyone to read any of it, but the few people who do are actually willing to let me know how it made them laugh, helped them out a bit, or gave them some inspiration on improving their own work.

it's crazy how much more i managed to learn just by deciding to share some crap out on the internet.
