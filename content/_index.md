A funny anime character and pseudonymous identity. 

Plenty of people know who I am IRL - I'm just air gapping
my personal network from any idiots out there. 

**I'm a programmer based in Toronto.** The singularity is
already here, but I might have a chance at being useful if
I focus on AI work.

I never formally studied this stuff, but I ended up coding
everyday for fun and for work. 

You can reach me via Twitter DMs or Github.
